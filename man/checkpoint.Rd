\title{Evaluates an expression or loads a previously checkpointed value}
\usage{
checkpoint(expr, ..., ckpt.id = NULL, force = FALSE,
  check.deps = TRUE, envir = parent.frame(), enclos = environment(),
  file = "checkpoint.dat")
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{any valid R expression}

\item{...}{any one or more R objects that are monitored for changes and used to trigger re-evaluation}

\item{ckpt.id}{an identifier used for the checkpointed data}

\item{force}{force re-evaluation of the expression}

\item{check.deps}{whether or not to check the dependent variables in \code{...} for changes}

\item{envir}{the environment in which \code{expr} is evaluated}

\item{enclos}{the environment in which \code{expr} is substituted}

\item{file}{the checkpoint file name}
}
\value{
the result of running \code{expr} or the checkpointed value
}
\description{
Both the change to the environment and the expression's return value is stored.
The expression is re-evaluated if the expression or value of the dependent variables change.

checkpointr::checkpoint(
  {
    x <- 42
